You can enhance your Whac-A-Mole game by adding various features to make it more engaging and entertaining. Here are some ideas:

Levels: Introduce different levels of difficulty with increasing speed, more moles, or additional challenges as the player progresses.

Timer: Add a countdown timer for each round. The player has to whack as many moles as possible within the given time.

Sound Effects: Include sound effects for whacking moles, game over, and other events to make the game more immersive.

Animations: Use animations for moles appearing and disappearing, creating a more dynamic and visually appealing experience.

Power-ups: Introduce power-ups that can either help the player (e.g., bonus points, extra time) or create additional challenges (e.g., faster moles).

High Score: Implement a high score system to encourage players to compete against their own or others' best scores.

Special Moles: Add special moles with different characteristics, such as bonus points or penalties when whacked.

Multiplayer Mode: Allow players to compete against each other in real-time or asynchronously.

Settings Menu: Provide options for players to customize game settings, such as difficulty level, sound preferences, or even mole appearance styles.

Responsive Design: Ensure your game works well on different screen sizes and devices for a better user experience.

Tutorial/Instructions: Include a tutorial or instructions to guide new players on how to play the game effectively.

Achievements and Badges: Reward players with achievements or badges for reaching specific milestones or completing challenges.

Pause and Resume: Allow players to pause the game and resume later, especially in timed modes.

Game Over Screen: Create an engaging game over screen with a summary of the player's performance, encouraging them to play again.

Random Events: Introduce occasional random events that either help or hinder the player's progress.

Remember to maintain a good balance between challenge and enjoyment to keep players engaged. Feel free to mix and match these features based on your preferences and the overall theme of your game.
